Abstract: 123

Background: Fractals dimension (Df) is the quantification measure of blood vessels branching pattern. The retinal Df is reported to be a sensitive indicator in early vascular changes in various ocular vascular diseases like diabetic retinopathy. To the best of our knowledge, there is no inbuilt method to measure the Df by the commercially available retinal imaging devices.
Aim: The paper describes a new custom method that helps in quantifying Df using the Graphical User Interface.

Method: Sixty-six consecutive clinically normal subjects who underwent retinal images by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA; Cirrus 5000, Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc., Dublin, CA) enrolled in the study. The 6x6 mm en-face images of superficial and deep retinal layers image and 512x128 fundus images were used for Df the analysis. The Df was calculated using the newly developed automated algorithm. 

Results: The median (IQR) age and axial length (AL) of the study subjects was 22.00 (21.00-34.00) years and 23.26 (22.94-23.84) mm. The median (IQR) Df for retinal fundus, superficial and deep retinal layers were 1.48 (1.47-1.49), 1.25 (1.24-1.28), and 1.27 (1.25-1.29) respectively. 

Conclusion: The Df of the retinal vessels can be reliably measured from OCTA-generated images. However, the Df didnâ€™t influence by either aging or AL. There was a weak negative correlation found between fundus Df and Best-corrected visual acuity (r = -0.243, p=0.050) and superficial retina Df and AL (r = -0.284, p=0.021).
